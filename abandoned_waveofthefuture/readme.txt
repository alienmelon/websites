This is an abandoned project.
It was supposed to be alienmelon.com but then I built that using something else.
It's not much but the most interesting thing to salvage from it is collision detection between divs, and text that writes out.

You control the character with the keyboard keys and would fly around on the site, talking to elements of the website. The site would be a game.

I might re-visit this someday since I love the novelty of divs, and other page elements, interacting with eachother as if they are game sprites.

(note: the source is very messy because I wrote most of this while crashing on people's couches, between parties, and sometimes drunk...)
