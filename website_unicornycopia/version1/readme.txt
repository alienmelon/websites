This is the old website for "Everything is going to be OK" formerly unicornycopia.com/
A distorted glitchy landscape with download buttons floating in the distance.
CSS customized pop-up windows for ABOUT, a SCREENSHOTS photo gallery (very simple), and falling potatoes...
A "Click" mouse sound plays whenever you Click.
This was a simple and fantastic site.
