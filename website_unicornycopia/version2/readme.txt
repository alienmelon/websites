This is the full Unicornycopia website (http://unicornycopia.com/)
Includes the page for "Everything is going to be OK" (http://unicornycopia.com/unicornycopia.html)
A strange website featuring all the bells-and-whistles of a presskit...
The main menu page (index.html) is a skeleton page (meant for pointing to other games). It has some interesting CSS including fullpage background, and sound plays on click with a skeleton gif being placed...

The presskit for EIGTBOK (unicornycopia.html) has pop ups for about, awards, and an "image gallery" for screenshots that basically just opens an iframe and points to an open directory (a good alternative for making a javascript slideshow...). The videos section does the same.
There's audio on the page that plays if you choose so (soundtrack for it).
Potatoes fall when you open things. A small banner for the Electric Love Potato shows after a while.
Goldfish are floating (this is a cute js script...).

Overall, salvage from it what you will.
