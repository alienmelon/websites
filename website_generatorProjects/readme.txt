These are the majority of my generators (procgen projects that run in the browser, written in various flavors of .js)...
The site is here http://generators.alienmelon.com/
A few of these are Edge Animate projects.
definethis, planetarium, reviewthis, and enhance... are vanilla js projects.
enhance has a cute typing effect (write out letters) that you can use!
