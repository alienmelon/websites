This is the website for the Electric Zine Maker (http://unicornycopia.com/ezm/)
This is a Tumult Hype project.
Salvage from it what you will...

The actual build is in the "index" folder.

Fun things:
Gravity that interacts with divs and other elements.
Collision detection (you can throw the rocks in the main menu at the actual menu and wreck it... Toggles physics states)
Good example to pick apart for figuring out how to use Tumult Hype's physics (matter.js)
Other collision detection is also used (drag the fish in the main menu to the crab and the crab eats it).
Dynamically changing physics states...
