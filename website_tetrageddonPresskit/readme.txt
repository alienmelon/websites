This is the presskit page for Tetrageddon.com (http://tetrageddon.com/presskit/)
It's one of my favorite pages that I made...
Features randomly loaded glitch art backgrounds that layer over eachother to make unique combinations of backgrounds. Has a glitchy gif playing in the background of all that to create lots of movement.
A fire gif is at the bottom, and "broken image" embers are emerging from that.
Has some audio that may or may not play depending on the browser (not necessary but it's nice to have when it works).
The main menu features all the normal presskit options. Information is delivered in a pretty pop-up window that opens in the center of the screen. It's a popup to make it less like a website and feel more like a strange fragment of a desktop.
